INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

This script requires PHP installed on your server, compiled with the GD image library (usually installed by default on most providers).

The script should work out of the box.

Unzip the counter folder and upload it to your web site, for example in your web root folder, public_html, httpdocs, /var/www or however it is called.

The web address of the counter script will then be:

/counter/counter.php

Grant 666 permission to the 2 text files, counter.txt and visitors_ips.txt. 

If you want to start the counter with a particular count number on it, just edit the counter.txt file in a text editor.

Link to counter.php as an image in your page(s):

<img src="/counter/counter.php" alt="page counter" title="Single visitors since XXXXXXX" style="width:80px;">

or also:

<img src="http://www.your-web-site.com/counter/counter.php" alt="page counter" title="Single visitors since XXXXXX" style="width:80px;">

This is it.

In the source code of the script you can edit manually the various colors used. By default, the counter background color rotates randomly between blue, black, orange, red, green, as define by RGB notation in the code, that you can easily edit.

There is also the option to have a fixed backgound color instead, by uncommenting a line. The code is less than 100 lines in total and well commented, so everything is very easy to find and of course change if you wish.

Have fun and remember to link to us if you like and use the script.
